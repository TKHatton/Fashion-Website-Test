# Fashion Awards Website Development Prompt

## Project Overview
I need to rebuild the landing page for the She Is AI Fashion Awards. I've provided two comprehensive reference documents with all content, messaging, and specifications:

1. **Fashion Awards Target Audiences & Messaging Guide** - Contains all target audience information, pain points, messaging pillars, tone guidelines, and language that resonates with each demographic
2. **Fashion Awards Categories Guide** - Complete specifications for all 5 fashion categories including descriptions, clothing types, design considerations, visual direction, motion ideas, and example AI prompts

## Current Website Reference
I've attached a screenshot of the current Fashion Awards website. This shows the existing layout and design approach. Use this as a reference for understanding the current state, but we're making significant updates.

## Design & Motion Requirements

### Visual Dynamics (Critical)
The website needs multiple types of visual movement to feel alive and engaging:

1. **Subtle Entry Animations**
   - Images that slide in and then shift slightly left or right
   - Gentle continuous micro-movements (not jarring)
   - Elements that ease into position

2. **Looping Video Backgrounds**
   - Small video clips showing fabric movement, people in motion, etc.
   - These should be subtle background elements, not full-screen takeovers
   - Optimized for web performance

3. **Full Video Sections**
   - Some sections should have full video backgrounds (you can't see these in the static screenshot, but they exist in the current site)
   - Videos should support the category aesthetic (runway walk, urban movement, etc.)

### Layout Philosophy
**DON'T:** Center everything in a basic, standard layout
**DO:** Create an asymmetric, editorial-style layout with:
- Content positioned to the left or right, not always centered
- Varied positioning throughout the page
- More edge and visual interest
- Still accessible and easy to navigate
- Modern, dynamic composition
- Think fashion magazine editorial layout, not corporate website

The current website is very accessible but feels too standard. I want to maintain accessibility while adding more visual sophistication and edge.

## Content Structure Priority

Follow this page structure (from the reference documents):

1. **Hero Section**
   - Mission-first messaging: "This is an empowerment program, not just a competition"
   - Economic empowerment through AI should be immediately clear
   - Countdown to January 17, 2026 deadline
   - Clear CTAs

2. **Multiple Pathways to Success** (NEW - Add this prominently)
   - Visual showing TWO major opportunities: Finalist Program + 3DD Metaverse Gallery
   - Make it clear this is NOT just 5 winners, but many opportunities
   - Emphasize 3DD as significant opportunity with real commercial potential

3. **What This Program Really Is**
   - Career accelerator positioning
   - The journey/timeline with actual dates
   - Clear value proposition
   - 6 months of mentorship for finalists

4. **How to Create AI Fashion** (Interactive Tutorial Section)
   - Tabbed or accordion interface
   - AI tool selection
   - Prompting guidance
   - Collection creation tips
   - Submission preparation

4. **True Value / Cost Comparison**
   - Fashion school vs. this program
   - Visual cost comparison
   - "$45 vs $120,000" messaging

5. **Who This Program Serves**
   - 5 audience persona cards (High School Students, College Students, Recent Graduates, Career Changers, Self-Taught Creatives)
   - Help users self-identify
   - Reduce imposter syndrome

6. **Explore the Categories**
   - 5 full-width category sections (Red Carpet, Loungewear, Athleisurewear, Streetwear, Proleisurewear™)
   - Each with specific visual treatment per the Categories Guide
   - Motion/video backgrounds specific to each category
   - Category-specific gradient overlays for text readability

7. **Why This Initiative Matters**
   - Mission statement about democratizing fashion
   - Statistics about barriers
   - Vision for change

8. **What Finalists Actually Receive**
   - Detailed benefit cards
   - "$10,000-$15,000 value" emphasis
   - Clear finalist program details

## Key Messaging to Emphasize Throughout

From the reference documents, these messaging pillars must be clear:

1. **Mission First:** Economic empowerment through AI, not just pretty designs
2. **Accessibility:** No fashion school required, AI opens doors
3. **Multiple Pathways to Win:** 5 Finalists + 3DD Metaverse Gallery opportunities (NOT just 5 winners)
4. **Real Opportunity:** $10,000-$15,000 value for 6 months of mentorship for finalists
5. **3DD Metaverse Gallery:** Significant commercial opportunity for many more participants beyond finalists
6. **Inclusive:** For high school students to career changers
7. **Transformation:** "From AI concept to runway reality" (for finalists) and "From AI concept to metaverse showcase" (for 3DD featured designs)
8. **Career Accelerator:** Not just a competition
9. **Deadline Urgency:** January 17, 2026 - applications close soon

## Entry Fee Structure
- **One Category:** $45
- **Two Categories:** $90
- **Requirement:** Each entry must be a unique 5-piece collection
- **ROI Message:** "$45 could get you into a $10,000-$15,000 mentorship program OR featured in the 3DD Metaverse Gallery with global exposure"

## Category-Specific Visual Direction

Each of the 5 categories needs distinct visual treatment:

1. **Red Carpet:** Black to Crimson gradient, dramatic lighting, fabric billowing
2. **Loungewear:** Warm Beige to Soft Coral gradient, gentle movement, serene
3. **Athleisurewear:** Deep Blue to Mint gradient, dynamic action, athletic energy
4. **Streetwear:** Black to Coral gradient, urban setting, confident movement
5. **Proleisurewear™:** Cool Grey to Deep Blue gradient, modern workspace, transitional

## What Success Looks Like

The final website should:
- Feel modern, dynamic, and sophisticated (not corporate or basic)
- Have visual movement and energy throughout (subtle animations, videos, micro-interactions)
- Use an editorial-style, asymmetric layout (not everything centered)
- Clearly communicate the She Is AI mission of economic empowerment
- Make all 5 target audiences feel welcome and capable
- Guide users through understanding AI fashion creation
- Drive applications with clear CTAs
- Feel accessible while having edge and visual interest
- Maintain high performance despite rich media

## Reference Documents

All content, messaging, audience information, category specifications, visual direction, motion ideas, and technical requirements are detailed in the two reference markdown documents provided. Use these as the authoritative source for all copy, structure, and design decisions.

## Questions to Consider During Development

- Does each section have appropriate motion/animation?
- Is the layout varied and interesting, not just centered content?
- Are all 5 categories visually distinct from each other?
- Is the mission clear immediately upon landing?
- Can users easily identify which audience they belong to?
- Are CTAs prominent and clear throughout?
- Does it feel like a modern fashion brand with edge?
- Is it still fully accessible despite the dynamic design?

Build this website following the specifications in the reference documents while creating a visually dynamic, asymmetric, editorial-style layout with appropriate motion and video elements throughout.
